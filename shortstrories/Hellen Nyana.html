            <P>The chick in the purple top, high waist skirt and kitten heels definitely knows how to dress in an understated yet alluring sort of way.Not a hair out of place-I had to stop and stare just to make sure there really was not a hair out of place-subtle make-up and clean, short,fingernails. The fastened buttons of her button-down shirt stop slightly above her bosom, giving me an ever so slight peep as she heaves in subtle anticipation.She is a snob though.</P>
            <p>Earlier on, when i tried to introduce myself, she had politely answered, but had deliberately refused to give me her name, walking off instead and sitting at the other end of the table where she pretends to read a book. No one can convince me they can concentrate on a book while waitin for a life altering experience so she has to be faking it.Then, there is the breast-feeding chick.Not thaaround her chest attracts even more attention to the already lifted boobs, thanks to an obviously effective push-up bra.</p>
            <p>She keeps checking herself in her pocket mirror and adding layers of grease on her lips.She might be bored, like all of us are in the waiting room but she definitely intends to rely heavily on her "bosom buddies"to nail the job.Those boobs better do a good job today or i would hate to think what she will do to them if they fail laughing.
â€œYes, Aunt Janet said it makes We always stole from his treet</p> men in the city. He had so much money he
could buy the whole village and its contents.
            That morning aunt brought out the metal she brought from the city. It was for piercing ears. Aun.
