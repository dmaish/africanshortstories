        <h1>Getting somewhere</h1>
            <p>You are a boy of ten again.You are on the bus, and the trees seem to be going faster than the bus you are seated in.YOu are on the Kampala-Masaka Highway.You cannot wait to reach Kampala  as it will be your first time there.The excitement darts through your body like grasshopers jumping from grass blade to  grass blade.</p>
            <p>You keep standing to catch a glimpse of the speeding trees, and then sitting down heavily onto your mother's lap as if you are falling into a chair padded with cushions "But Vincent, why don't you settle down?!You will break my bones!Now see..." Your mother points down to the heavy lemon green <i>gomesi</i>.Its tassels are trailing on the bus floor, covered in red soil.</p>
            <p>"You see now you have dirtied my <i>musiipi?</i>Do you know how hard <i>gomesis</i> are hard to clean!"You look at her attire covered in bright greens, blues and oranges. Mzee bought it for her last

You open your mouth to sink your teeth into it, but the gonja disappears! You start to ask your
mother about it, but stop because she is not there anymore. Yet, you are still on the bus.
You touch your chin and it is rough with a beard. You look down at your feet and they have
grown so long. Your shorts are gone and you’re wearing trousers.
<p>“Vinnie, Vinnie ...” It’s Chantal’s sweet voice. But she sounds so far off...You let her voice get
carried away in the loud swish of the speeding trees...And you still have to find your mother...
You follow her through the narrow bus corridor and call out to her but she does not stop. You
continue to follow her, until all the faces on the bus meld into a smooth blackness. But her bright
gomesi
You open your eyes. Chantal is staring down at you. “You were dreaming,” she says. Her voice
soothes you. She strokes your ear and says, “Good morning, love?” She heard you whimpering like</p>
