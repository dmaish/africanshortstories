        <h1>The Gem and your dreams</h1>

            <p>You have probably noted your dreams down in a well decorated pad, in careful handwriting, one that you use only when it is something very important.You use a pen that was given to you by you as a gift or one that is unique from all the other pens,You feel that if you use rare materials to write your dreams down, the faster they will be realized.</p>
            <p>You tear the paper out of the notebook, fold it and keep it under your pillow, where no one but you and God can see.Sometimes ,you get the paper out ,and reading through it , you wonder,'How will I ever achieve these?'Your aunt’s place is in Buwate, Najjera, though she is usually up-country on official duty. It’s a
two roomed self-contained house with a kitchen and living room, garlanded with different species
of flowers placed inside cracked plastic buckets, running round the house near its green sadolin
colored wall. <p>Plants with tendrils emanate from the broken concrete on the verandah and cling
onto the wall accompanied by ivy. On the inside, the floor is maroon in color with a few cracks
peeping through. The living room is completely free of dust. There’s a large wooden chair that
seats three and two others that seat one. Their cushions are maroon and white, complementing the
floor. A wooden yellowish table set stands in the middle of the room covered with hand knitted
cloths, an empty flower vase sits on the main table. Pictures are stuck on the walls with tape which
has been worn out by air over time.
You leave home dressed in the black trendy skinnies a buddy gave you and the red collared ill-
fitting t-shirt you are fond of, which bears the words: I AM A BIG MAN. It’s a good luck t-shirt
            even though it sustained an injury through a nail hanging on the wall in your room. </p>
            You cover it up
with a jacket, pick something under your pillow and place it in the jacket pocket. You fit your feet
into the sandals you always leave by the doorstep, pluck the key from the inside and make sure you
lock the house on your way out.
Twenty minutes pass while you’re in a taxi and you find yourself at a cheap bar in Kiwatule. The
bar - which has room for only ten people at any given time - holds an old black and white Panasonic
TV that serves as the only entertainment. Judging from the bar’s shelves, the drinks are as good as
done. <p>The light source is a blue bulb; its soft glow is responsible for the slim cosiness of the bar. To
12your surprise, Karen is already there, sipping on a Sprite. She perceives an image of you, gets up to
massage your body with a passionate cuddle that you’ve missed. You both get ensconced in the
chairs. You waste no time in trying to achieve the main goal of the meeting.
‘Hey baby, I have been meaning to talk to you about something’. You look down at the table and
wonder how you are going to start.
‘Hey, you’re frightening me, is it something that could destroy us?’ She is filled with
consternation, her face is all crumpled. How are you going to make a clean breast of whatever you
            perjured before and at the same time tell her about your dreams?</p>
‘No, no, it’s nothing to worry about. Everything is Ok.’ You look at the relieved face of the
beautiful woman seated across the table and suddenly you wondered how you’ll be able to confess
what a broke-ass you are?! But you have to say something, to cover up what you started.
‘Honey, I have been meaning to tell you that you are the first of my dreams to be achieved.
You are glad something came out right, and you hope it will be taken right.
‘Are you sure about that Sam?’ She smiles that smile you always see whenever you close your eyes
and think of her. ‘Prove it!’ she says. You’re glad she actually asked you to prove it. Even more</p>
