        <h1>That same night</h1>
        <section>
            <p>He charmed me with his pleasurebundles.Heassured me of pleasure everyday.He took me around his castles and asked me to stay.I forgot about my pinples,I only felt melted and could only feel my dimples.I swear I could only look forward to his nightly play That same night,</p>
His body moved like ripples.hands felt softer than clay. smooch gave me tickles.form warmer than an overlay.That same night,He began to sway.curved inlikea sickle.<p>shoved me away.He chased me liketrouble.He denied me my pay,
He only gave me prickles.That same nightcouldnâ€™t believe the betray, left in hustles.rushed for the subway. was all left a ramshackle, only had to pray. dreaded that one night.</p>
