            <P> Once so very a long time ago in the land of the luos,the land of the exsorbitant men who could not resist to bang their chest and brag to whoever cared to listen about how many cows they owned...there lived a quiet but respected man who was known as Odhiambo.He lived with his lovely wife Anyango who was as beautiful as her name suggested although age had already started knocking at her door “If you had told me where you were from, I wouldn’t have told you to pay that high consultation

inspired by an Adams Family episode. At the back of the classroom, bags were sprawled all over the
floor, since there were not enough hooks on the wall to carry them all. I looked up at the man who
I assumed was the class teacher, as I’d heard my daddy address him as Mr. Muhangazima, and
